# Data-driven corrections of the 1D heat equation

This repository contains the code used for my master's thesis.

###File overview:

- config.py: Main configuration file.
- datasets.py: Used for creating training, validation and test sets.
- determine_fine_resolution.py: Used for determining the spatial and temporal resolution required for the numerical
  solution to change less than some pre-determined amount as the spatial grid is refined by a factor 3
  or as the temporal grid is refined by a factor 2.
- inspect_dataset.py: Used for verifying that the data generated by datasets.py is correct.
- inspect_systems.py: Used for visualizing the temporal development of different physical systems.
- main.py: Main entry point for training and evaluating data-driven correction models. Supported command line options:
    - --dataset: Create new dataset.
    - --train: Train new model.
    - --test: Evaluate the performance of a trained model.
- models.py: Defines different neural network models.
- physics.py: The numerical solver of the 1D heat equation which is used by datasets.py to generate data.
- test.py: Used for evaluating the performance of a trained model.
- train.py: Used for training a model.
- util.py: Contains various helper functions.
